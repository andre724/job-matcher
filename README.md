# Job Classification ML Project

A machine learning pipeline that scrapes job postings and classifies them by category and experience level.

## Project Goals

- Learn end-to-end ML pipeline development
- Practice web scraping with OOP design
- Build and deploy a job classification model
- Gain experience with Docker and MLOps practices

## Architecture

- **Phase 1**: Web scraping with modular OOP scrapers
- **Phase 2**: Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Phase 3**: Feature engineering and labeling
- **Phase 4**: Model training (Logistic Regression â†’ BERT)
- **Phase 5**: Evaluation and analysis
- **Phase 6**: Docker deployment
- **Phase 7**: Web interface (optional)

## Tech Stack

- **Scraping**: requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
- **ML**: scikit-learn, pandas, nltk/spaCy
- **Deployment**: Docker, FastAPI
- **Data**: Currently targeting RemoteOK

## Current Status

- [x] Project structure and base scraper architecture
- [ ] RemoteOK scraper implementation
- [ ] Data pipeline design
- [ ] ... (rest of phases)

## Setup

```bash
poetry install
# Usage instructions coming soon...
